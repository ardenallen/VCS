#Virtual Clinical Simulation (VCS)
VCS is a proof of concept prototype of virtual clinical simulation training software. It is aiming to solve the problem for medical students who do not have the accessibility to the real clinical training centre, especially in developing countries.

The prototype is designed around a specific clinical scenario of a young male patient sustaining a motor vehicle crash suffering with hypotensive shock. In the scenario, the student is expected to do a typical patient assessment; asking the patient how they are, monitoring their vitals and conducting a physical assessment. Upon that, discovering that the patient has suffered trauma to his pelvic region. 

## Getting Started
The project is split into two client ends: VR end for students and PC end for instructors. These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Hardware Requirements
For running the student end, the Oculus Quest is required, you can buy the device through this link: https://www.oculus.com/quest/where-to-buy/

Due to the calculation power of Oculus Quest and 3D assets quality in the prototype, it needs to run by PC. Please access here for purchasing a USB cable which can enable Oculus Link function.
